# SOLID-Principles
Notes about what I observe and reflect
* Self Explanatory Code : No Comments
* Pull, Clean, Push
* Command / Query Separation : Query module should not effect state of system
* Code Smells (DRY, Long Methods, Big Class, Feature Envy, Useless Comment, Poor naming, Inappropriate Intimacy, Shotgun Surgery, Switchm God class, Primitive obsession, Refused Bequest)
* Code Smells Corrections -> Manage Dependencies, Separate Concerns, Apply SOLID)
